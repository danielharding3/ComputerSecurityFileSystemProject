# ComputerSecurityFileSystemProject
CS419 File System Security Project

Project Description:

• A protected file system

• For a given folder and files inside, the system only allows the account Alice to use certain programs to
  create/read/edit/delete it

• You need to assign correct permissions

• Other accounts are not able to read the content

• Purely user level file system is fine


Usage:

For SecFS.java:

TO COMPILE THE PROGRAM:
  $> make

TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
  (If run.sh doesn't have permission to execute):
  $> chmod +x run.sh

  Once permissions are given to run.sh, you only have to run below command
  $> ./run.sh
