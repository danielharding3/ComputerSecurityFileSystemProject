CS419 File System Security Project

Project Description:
• A protected file system
• For a given folder and files inside, the system only allows the account Alice to use certain programs to 
  create/read/edit/delete it
• You need to assign correct permissions
• Other accounts are not able to read the content
• Purely user level file system is fine
